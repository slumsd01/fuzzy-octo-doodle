# sit + stay

## Description
**sit + stay** is a bulletin-board-style website where pet owners can make a profile to manage their pets and share posts about them! **sit + stay** was designed with intended purpose of connecting pet owners with people who are willing to help take care of their pets if needed. For example, if a pet owner was planning a trip where Fido was unable to along, they could simply ask for help from a friend on **sit + stay**! In the same way, potential pet sitters are able to join to keep an eye out for potential jobs and tasks.
